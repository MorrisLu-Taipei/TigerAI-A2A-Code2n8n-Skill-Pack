# TigerAI Code2n8n Skill Pack — User Manual

> 🌐 **English** | [繁體中文](README.zh.md)
> 📖 **Why Code2n8n?** Read the [Code2n8n manifesto](CODE2N8N.md) — why enterprises need n8n *more* in the AI-coding era, not less.

> **The Code2n8n positioning**: AI Coding (Claude Code / Codex / Antigravity) is great at *writing* code. n8n is great at making code *manageable by an enterprise*. This pack is the bridge — **describe a requirement, *or* point at an existing system** (Apps Script / Express / Lambda / Docker stack), and get a runnable n8n workflow that IT, operations, and managers can all read, audit, hand off, and govern.

![TigerAI Code2n8n Skill Pack — Code2n8n hero (v16 user-remaster)](docs/images/code2n8n-hero-en.png)

> 📊 **The whole pack in one picture**: Natural-language intent *or* an existing program system → Code2n8n Skill Pack (Cookbook + 2,061 reference workflows + DSL v1.2 + **15 manifest skills** + 4 enterprise patterns) → decides what logic stays as code vs lifts into an n8n node → emits a reviewable, hand-off-able, cross-system n8n workflow.
> *by n8n Taipei Ambassador Morris Lu*

## 🔄 Two Code2n8n paths

This pack does more than turn sticky notes into workflows. It supports two directions:

```text
Path A: from zero
natural language / yellow sticky note
  → sticky-note-to-workflow
  → n8n workflow

Path B: port an existing system
Apps Script / Express / Lambda / Netlify Functions / Docker stack
  → code-to-workflow (inventory, dedicated security gate, partition, port, validate, version/rollback evidence)
  → code modules + n8n workflow + migration docs
```

Code2n8n **does not transliterate every line of Python or JavaScript into nodes**. It re-partitions the system: complex algorithms stay in code, while triggers, cross-system wiring, retries, human approvals, notifications, and execution history lift into a visible, manageable workflow.

> **AI Coding solves "how is the function built"; Code2n8n solves "how is the capability modularized *and audited*"; n8n solves "how the modules cooperate across the whole enterprise."**

### 🧪 Proof bar — the marquee skill is grounded in 3 real ports

| Case | Upstream → n8n | Headline number |
|---|---|---|
| [Google Workspace admin](examples/google-workspace-admin-workflow/) | 1,373-line Apps Script → 7 workflows (core + entry + setup) | Line-by-line `PROVENANCE.md` + import 7/7 |
| [LINE customer service (cloud)](examples/line-ai-customer-service/) | Netlify + Supabase → core + entry + approach-C admin | Import 6/6 |
| [LINE customer service (on-prem)](examples/line-ai-customer-service-onprem/) | Docker + Postgres + Redis + Qdrant + Ollama → 37-node brain | 5-phase V&V + ⚠️ `SECURITY-CAVEATS.md` (deliberately not deployable) |

Full evidence table further down. The bar above is what *immediately* backs the two-path claim — if any of these three case studies disappear, the claim weakens.

> 🛠️ **Responsibility boundary**: The third block of the hero diagram ("n8n Enterprise Orchestration") lists SSO / IAM / audit log / HA — **n8n Enterprise ships these out of the box**, the Pack does not reimplement them. The Pack's job is to make sure Code2n8n-produced workflows *land cleanly* on top (IAM-friendly, queue-safe, rollback-traceable). The split between Pack / n8n Enterprise / your IT, and the workflow-design rules that follow, are in [`docs/enterprise-setup.md`](docs/enterprise-setup.md).

## 🤖 This is an Agentic Engineering Example

> **This entire project was authored using AI Agentic IDEs (Antigravity / Claude Code) — from spec to n8n workflows, every artifact was produced through human-AI agent collaboration.**

This Skill Pack is itself a working demo of **Agentic Engineering**:

| Dimension | Traditional way | This project (Agentic) |
|---|---|---|
| **Spec writing** | Engineer types every word | Chat with AI → AI produces SDD (Spec-Driven Design) |
| **n8n workflow dev** | Drag nodes on canvas | Write a yellow sticky note → AI emits runnable JSON |
| **Skill / plugin authoring** | Read docs, copy templates | Claude Code Skills + Antigravity `.agent/workflows/` orchestration |
| **Acceptance testing** | Run cases by hand, write report | AI runs 8 scenarios → auto-emits [`tests/REPORT-3.en.md`](tests/REPORT-3.en.md) |
| **Docs / README / CHANGELOG** | Backfilled after coding | Generated alongside code |
| **Third-party license compliance** | Manual review | AI detects leaked secrets, scrubs them, generates `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` |

### Agentic footprints in this repo

- **`skills/`** — `plugin.json` registers **15 Claude Code / Antigravity skills**; each `SKILL.md` is co-authored by humans and AI
- **`.agent/workflows/`** — Antigravity-native agentic workflows (e.g. `/install-n8n-pack` one-shot installer)
- **`cookbook/`** — 8 natural-language → workflow examples showing how to "talk to" the AI
- **`spec/sticky-note-three-layer.md`** — Three-layer structure spec that forces reviewable AI output
- **`research/patterns.md`** — 7 canonical skeletons + anti-patterns mined by AI from 2,061 real workflows
- **`reference-workflows/`** — AI training corpus ([Zie619/n8n-workflows](https://github.com/Zie619/n8n-workflows), MIT, secrets scrubbed)

### Who should study this project

- Developers / PMs learning **how to use an AI agent as an engineering teammate**
- Teams who already have **Apps Script, Express, Lambda, Netlify Functions, or a Docker stack** and want to evaluate **what stays in code vs what moves into n8n**
- Teams evaluating **whether Antigravity / Claude Code can replace hand-written skills / workflows**
- Anyone curious **what real human-AI co-authored engineering output looks like**

> 💡 In other words: this isn't just "a Skill Pack for n8n" — it's also an open **case study of how AI agents build a real product**.

### 👥 You (the user) can build n8n workflows the same way

**Once you install this Skill Pack, you can author your own n8n workflows with the same agentic approach** — no node syntax to learn, no code to write:

| Tool | What you do | What the AI does |
|---|---|---|
| **Antigravity** | Open your n8n project in Antigravity, run `/install-n8n-pack`, then describe what you want in plain language | `.agent/workflows/` auto-reads your intent → emits workflow JSON → deploys via n8n API |
| **Claude Code (CLI / VS Code)** | Run `bash install.sh` (or `install.ps1`) in your working dir, then describe a new requirement *or* point at existing code | Skills auto-load → generate a workflow from scratch, or run the full Code2n8n port |
| **Any AI assistant (ChatGPT / Gemini)** | Paste an example from [`cookbook/`](cookbook/00-INDEX.en.md) as a few-shot prompt | Imitates the three-layer structure and emits a compliant workflow JSON |

**Typical interaction** (30-second mental model):

```text
You ──> AI: "Every weekday 9am, pull Shopify orders, build a daily
             report, email it to the boss; on failure post to Slack #ops"

AI ──> You: ✅ workflow.json generated (Schedule → Shopify → Code → Email + Error → Slack)
             ✅ Yellow sticky: your original requirement, preserved
             ✅ Blue sticky: which credentials, constraints, test method
             ✅ Deployed to your n8n via API, webhook URL: https://...
```

> 🎯 **The core idea**: Users don't need to memorise n8n node syntax — clear requirements are enough to get a structured, reviewable, maintainable workflow. To claim it's *production-ready* still requires credential setup, live validation, and a security audit.

If you already have code, don't rewrite it into a sticky note. Just say:

> "Use `code-to-workflow` to inventory this project, decide what stays in code vs moves to n8n; do the security audit first, then emit SDD, workflow, and validation results."

See [`02-USAGE-MODES.en.md`](02-USAGE-MODES.en.md) (three intent-driven modes) and [`03-FIRST-WORKFLOW.en.md`](03-FIRST-WORKFLOW.en.md) (15-minute hands-on); for porting existing code, go straight to [`code-to-workflow`](skills/tigerai/code-to-workflow/SKILL.md).

## ⚡ Understand it in 90 seconds

### What it does

You drop a **yellow sticky note** on the n8n canvas and write (in any language):

```text
Every day at 9 AM, fetch sales data and email the daily report to my boss.
On failure, notify Slack #ops.
```

You ask AI to build it. The canvas now shows a complete workflow:

```
┌─ Yellow sticky: your requirement (preserved as-is)
├─ Middle: AI-generated nodes (Schedule → HTTP → Code → Email)
└─ Blue sticky: AI's notes (credentials needed, assumptions, limitations, how to test)
```

No code. No syntax to learn. No need to memorize n8n node names.

### Four usage modes

| Mode | When | Trigger phrase |
|---|---|---|
| 🪄 Cookbook copy | You know what you want, fast | Copy from [cookbook](cookbook/00-INDEX.en.md) |
| 💬 Q&A mode | You have no idea how to describe it | "enable Q&A mode" / "問答模式" |
| 🔍 Example finder | Want to see prior art first | "find examples for X" / "範例查詢" |
| 🔄 Code2n8n port | You have existing code or a system and want it governable in n8n | "Use `code-to-workflow` to analyse and port this project" |

The first three start from intent. The fourth starts from existing code. Full Code2n8n methodology: [`skills/tigerai/code-to-workflow/SKILL.md`](skills/tigerai/code-to-workflow/SKILL.md).

## 🛠️ Pain points this Pack solves

| Pain | Solution |
|---|---|
| AI-written workflows are inconsistent, hard to review | Enforce three-layer structure |
| Users don't know how to describe what they want | Plain-language stickies + 8 cookbooks + Q&A mode |
| AI doesn't know n8n well enough | 6 vendor official Skills + 2,061 workflow corpus |
| Don't know what existing code to keep vs move into n8n | `code-to-workflow` 7-step methodology + 3 empirical case studies |
| AI-written code demos fine but auth / SQL / secret management may not ship | Mandatory **Step 1.5 security audit**; unresolved findings disclosed via `SECURITY-CAVEATS.md` |
| No enterprise-grade patterns | 4 pillars: Atomic Orchestration / Universal Worker / SDD / Security |
| Don't know where to start | `03-FIRST-WORKFLOW.en.md` 15-min hands-on |

## 🧪 Code2n8n empirical case studies

| Case | Code2n8n path | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| [Google Workspace admin workflow](examples/google-workspace-admin-workflow/) | 1,373-line Apps Script → core + entry n8n workflows | Line-by-line `PROVENANCE.md`; static lint 0 err / 0 warn; n8n REST import 7/7 |
| [LINE AI customer service (cloud)](examples/line-ai-customer-service/) | Netlify Functions + Supabase → n8n runtime + approach-C admin UI | Static lint 0 err / 0 warn; n8n REST import 6/6 |
| [LINE AI customer service (on-prem)](examples/line-ai-customer-service-onprem/) | Docker + Postgres + Redis + Qdrant + Ollama + n8n | 37-node workflow; 5-phase V&V; security audit disclosed major defects — **DO NOT DEPLOY AS-IS** |

The third case deliberately preserves the upstream POC's security defects and documents them in [`SECURITY-CAVEATS.md`](examples/line-ai-customer-service-onprem/SECURITY-CAVEATS.md). This isn't "failed acceptance swept under the rug" — it's Code2n8n's core principle: **AI-written software that runs is not automatically software an enterprise can deploy.**

---

## 📊 Historical baseline acceptance (v0.9.0 R3)

The numbers below were the real-environment baseline for three-layer workflow generation as of **v0.9.0 R3**; the current pack version is **v0.22.2**, and the three Code2n8n case studies above are the v0.22.x evidence layer that supersedes pure-generation acceptance.

| Layer | Pass rate |
|---|---|
| JSON parse | 8/8 (100%) |
| n8n CLI Import | 8/8 (100%) |
| API Activate | 7/8 (87.5%) — T3 blocked by real Telegram bot token check |
| Webhook routing | 4/4 (100%) |
| Full execute success | 2/4 (with `continueOnFail` design) |
